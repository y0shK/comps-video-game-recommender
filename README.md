# Using Word Embeddings to Predict Video Game Recommendations (Senior Comprehensive Project)

## Description
This project is a supervised learning model that uses word embeddings of short-form video game text ("deck") and long-form video game paragraphs ("descripion") to predict recommendations. The dataset comes from a combination of titles from a Metacritic CSV and GameSpot API calls. After building the dataset, a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is trained on word embedding vectors of deck and description (vectors are generated by the TensorFlow Universal Sentence Encoder). Synthetic minority oversampling is used to offset the class imbalance (of recommended games to noise) and principal component analysis is used to project the high-dimensional vectors into R^2.  

## How to Run
* obtain API key from GiantBomb and GameSpot
* put API key into .env
* download metacritic\_game\_info.csv from Kaggle link, and put in same directory as recommendation.py
* create conda environment and use: conda create --name YOUR_ENV --file requirements.txt
* python recommendation.py

## Threats to Validity
* word embedding models only use deck and description
